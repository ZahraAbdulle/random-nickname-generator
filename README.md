# Random Nickname Generator

A simple yet entertaining tool that generates whimsical nicknames by combining random words with optional transformations. Ideal for fun, demonstrations, or as a foundation for building a more advanced generator.

## How It Works

The generator constructs a nickname using a combination of:

- **Adjectives**: Descriptive words such as *Silent*, *Ancient*, etc.
- **Creatures**: Mythical or real creatures like *Phoenix*, *Kraken*, *Wolf*.
- **Suffixes**: Titles or roles such as *Slayer*, *Guardian*, *Rider*.
- **Optional leet transformation**: Replaces letters with numbers (e.g., *A → 4*, *E → 3*).
- **Optional random number**: Adds a number to ensure uniqueness.

## Features

- **Interactive** – Allows users to specify the number of nicknames, enable leet transformations, and more.
- **Fully Random** – Generates unique nicknames with every run.
- **Customisable** – Modify the word lists or introduce new transformations to suit your needs.
